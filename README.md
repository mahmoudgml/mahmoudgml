I'm a Computer & Information Sciences student with a strong focus on BI & Data Engineering.  
I build scalable and reliable data pipelines and analytics workflows, with hands-on experience using Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Apache Airflow, and dbt.  

I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Docker, Git, and Linux, with solid knowledge of databases, data warehousing, distributed systems, and algorithms.  
I also develop dashboards and analytical reports using Power BI, transforming raw data into meaningful insights and real business value.

My interests include modern data architecture, stream & batch processing, orchestration, and optimizing data workflows for performance and scalability.
